# README

## Introduction

This is a React + TypeScript + Vite project, providing a minimal setup for a restaurant management system. The project uses Vite for development and building, and includes ESLint rules for code quality and consistency.

## Project Structure

The project is structured as follows:

* `src/`: The source code directory, containing the main application code.
* `src/App.tsx`: The main application component.
* `src/main.tsx`: The entry point of the application.
* `src/vite-env.d.ts`: A file containing type definitions for the Vite environment.
* `public/`: A directory containing static assets, such as images and fonts.
* `src/assets/`: A directory containing CSS and other asset files.
* `src/components/`: A directory containing React components.
* `src/defaults/`: A directory containing default data and configurations.
* `src/logic/`: A directory containing business logic and utility functions.
* `src/roleMains/`: A directory containing role-specific main components.

## Configuration

The project uses a `tsconfig.json` file to configure the TypeScript compiler, and a `vite.config.ts` file to configure Vite.

## ESLint Configuration

The project uses ESLint to enforce code quality and consistency. The ESLint configuration is defined in the `.eslintrc.cjs` file.
